# Open-CV Projects

## [Gesture Volume Control](./Volume Control)

In this project i learned how to use Gesture Control to change the volume of a computer. I first looked into hand tracking and then used the hand landmarks to find gesture of our hand to change the volume. This project is module based which means i used a previously created hand module which makes the hand tracking very easy.

## [Virtual Mouse](./Virtual Mouse)
In this project, i created an AI based Mouse Controller. I first detected the hand landmarks and then track and click based on these points.I also applied smoothing techniques to make it more usable.
