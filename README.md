# Open-CV Projects

## [Gesture Volume Control](https://github.com/amanagrawal5510/Open-CV/tree/main/Volume%20Control)

In this project i learned how to use Gesture Control to change the volume of a computer. I first looked into hand tracking and then used the hand landmarks to find gesture of our hand to change the volume. This project is module based which means i used a previously created hand module which makes the hand tracking very easy.

## [Virtual Mouse](https://github.com/amanagrawal5510/Open-CV/tree/main/Virtual%20Mouse)
In this project, i created an AI based Mouse Controller. I first detected the hand landmarks and then track and click based on these points.I also applied smoothing techniques to make it more usable.
